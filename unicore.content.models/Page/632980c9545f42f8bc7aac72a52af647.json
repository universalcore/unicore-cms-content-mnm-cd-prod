Here is how malaria affected the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2012:\r\n\r\n\u2022\t100% of the population of the Democratic Republic of the Congo was living in an at-risk area where the malaria parasite was present.  \r\n\r\n\u2022\tIt is estimated that 17,000,000 people caught the disease, and 69,000 died, just from a simple mosquito bite. \r\n\r\n\u2022\tMalaria also cost the Democratic Republic of the Congo approximately 51,000,000 productive work days, which has a detrimental impact on the country\u2019s overall economy..\r\n\r\n**How you can help**\r\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be this way.  You can help protect your family, and your country, from malaria by taking a few simple steps:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tMake sure your whole family sleeps under a bed net every night.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tSeek testing, and then treatment, from a doctor or health worker at the first sign of illness.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tIf you are given treatment, make sure to finish your pills!\r\n \r\nTo learn more about malaria in your country, visit the Democratic Republic of the Congo malaria program.\r\n",
